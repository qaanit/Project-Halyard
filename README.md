# Project-Halyard

## Project Overview
### Goal/Vision: 
To develop a specialized AI agent grounded in the historical materialist methodology and perspectives of the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS). The agent aims to provide rigorous analysis of political, economic, cultural, and historical events, explicitly countering perceived biases in mainstream information sources and standard AI models.
### Core Philosophy: 
Project Halyard operates on the principle that AI development is not ideologically neutral. Therefore, its core objective is to consciously align the agent's analytical processes and outputs with a scientific, revolutionary perspective based on Historical Dialectical Materialism (HDM) and the analyses of the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS).
### Key Use Cases:
Analytical Q&A: Answering user questions about events or theory using HDM and WSWS author perspectives via the RAG agent.
Article Drafting Assistant: Taking current news stories or topics as input and generating draft articles that apply the WSWS analytical framework and style, leveraging the curated knowledge base via the RAG agent.
Geospatial Intelligence & Visualization (Cartography Module): Providing an interactive mapping platform (via Looker Studio/BigQuery) for users (organizers, and researchers) to explore and analyze the geographical distribution of facilities, related events, historical context, and potentially internal organizational intelligence relevant to class struggle.
